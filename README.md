# serialNumberGenerator
 This is a simple web app for generating random unique ID for a list of patients in the database
 I've created a simple sql which you can import  to test on your on your local machine, you can create yours too if you want.
 # Break down of how it works
 The database has a list of patients with an empty column named 'serial_number'
 Click on the ``list patient`` button to list all the patients in the database with ajax.
 The `generate ID` button will now appear with which you can  generate IDs for the patients.
 The generated ID is stored in the database.
 That's it!
